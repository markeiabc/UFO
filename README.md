# UFO

The purpose of this project was to visualize data we had regarding UFO sightings in a way that allows viewers to filter based on date, city, state, country, or shape. With the site created, it provides an overview of they consider a UFO sighting and the thoughts from the Ufologists. 

The data shared is based on very specific dates, cities, states, etc.. which presents a large sample size of locations and experiences. This provides the viewer more information to make a decision on whether or not they believe in UFOs. 

As we further develop this analysis, my recommendation would be group the sighting data by states then cities to look for patterns. This will help at looking for consistency in duration shapes. It would also be beneficial to have the filters listed as drop-downs for ease of use by the viewer.
